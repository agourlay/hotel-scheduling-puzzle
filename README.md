# hotel-scheduling-puzzle

This program schedules the bed occupation for an hotel.

We want to host the maximum number of guests possible.

As input:
- total number of beds available in the hotel
- the schedule of each guest start-end (the end of one guest can overlap with the start of another guest)

As output one schedule per bed.
